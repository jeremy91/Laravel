# laravel
A project started using Laravel.

This project is based on http://www.tutorials.kode-blog.com/laravel-hello-world.

Eventually when finishing the tutorial, I will attempt to modify it and build something unique from it. 

Notes that I learnt from laravel:

1) The basic flow of the progam: route.php -> controller.php -> view.php

2) route.php stores what files the app will access when typing in the url for e.g. Route::get('hello', 'Hello@index'); will 
return whatever is in the index function of hello.php in controllers.

3) controller.php will tell what view is to be used and other things as well

4) view.php displays the html that will be displayed

To create a new controller:

1) Navigate to folder 

2) Open terminal: php artisan make:controller Front

3) Update controller

4) Update routes

SEO depends on:

1) website url

2) website speed

3) social media stats

4) keywords = in headings etc
